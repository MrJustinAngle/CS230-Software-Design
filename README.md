# CS230-Software-Design


- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room is a game creator who had experienced success in their puzzle competition game, which was only available on the Android platform. The client was The Gaming Room they wanted help in developing a web-based version of the current Android game to make the game available to more players.
    
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    I believe I documented the Project Software Design document very well, giving pros and cons to each option. I made recommendations on what I think would be best for this game. I detailed out which operating system we should build the game on and why. 

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    Being able to analyze the domain model that was depicted was very beneficial as it helped me understand the relationships and structure between the entities that represent the app components. Which also helped in developing classes with methods that would leverage the other entities.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I think I would revise the evalutation and add more details into the Operating Systems. I would take a deeper dive into the pros and cons of the sytems giving more of a detailed look of each option.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Some key needs of the user would be speed and intuitiveness of the UI. This is ensuring the game would be easy to use and not confusting the gamer. It's important because it will be the first thing people see, it might also be the thing that makes the gamer play the game or not.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    I approached designing the software by looking at the previous code and working on to it to make it work as a web based game rather than an Android game. In the future I think I would possibly want to rewrite the code to ensure I know everything that is going on in the code.
